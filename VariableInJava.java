//        To create a value in java we can do as following
        int number=4;
//        here [int is datatype], [number is variable] and [4 is the value the variable stores]
        System.out.println(number); //println add new line after executing first line

}

//variable are character that store a value

//Data type is a set of values and a set of operations defined on those values
//INT,LONG,DOUBLE,SHORT,FLOAT,BYTE,CHAR,BOOL ARE PRIMITIVE Data type

//reserved word in java is called as keyword it cannot be use as variable or identifiers.

//Rules for declaring a variable name-:
//        Must not begin with a digit. (E.g., 1arry is an invalid variable)
//        Name is case sensitive. (Harry and harry are different)
//        Should not be a keyword (like Void).
//        White space is not allowed. (int Code With Harry is invalid)
//        Can contain alphabets, $character, _character, and digits if the other conditions are met.


//if a datatype contain n byte of space so formulae is-:
//         -((2^8n)/2) to ((2^8n)/2)-1
