/*Do- while loop is similar to a while loop except for the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least once.
Use a do-while loop when the exact number of iterations is unknown, but you need to execute a code block at least once.
After executing a part of a program for once, the rest of the code gets executed on the basis of a given boolean condition. */


/*Syntax-:
