//How to choose data type for our variable-:
//we first need to find the type of data we want to store and then we need to analyze the min and max value we might use
//for example for age we can use byte as its min and max is -128 and 127 but a person age is max to max 120 and min is 0 so here we can use byte

//literals-they are constant value that can be assigned to a value.
