      //Syntax Error-->
        //When compiler finds something wrong with our program it throws SYNTAX ERROR.
//        int a=5   <--- it is syntax error as semicolon is not given.
//        System.out.println(a+b); <--- it is also a syntax error as a and b are not defined.

        //Logical Error-->

//it happens due to wrong code of program and wrong queries.
